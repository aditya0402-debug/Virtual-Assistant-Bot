# Virtual-Assistant-Bot
A bot which provides voice command functionalities for listening to songs, searching info on the net and so on.

First, I have made use of Python library pip to install the additional dependencies required for the project, like speech recognition, text to speech, Pyaudio, wikipedia and several other important libraries.
The speech recognition module was used to give commands to the bot, Alexa who will reply with the help of the text to speech recognition module and execute your command.
But be informed, Alexa only listens if you will call her name, not without that!
Alexa can play songs on youtube, tell jokes to you, talk with you and also search info.
